## 📌 Why Store Owners Work With Us

Many online stores suffer from **“silent killers”** that drain profit without being obvious:

- ❌ Traffic but no sales
- ❌ People browsing but never buying
- ❌ Beautiful design but poor results

We fix problems such as:

- 🔴 Wrong country targeting  
- 🔴 Design that pleases eyes but not wallets  
- 🔴 No abandoned cart recovery setup  
- 🔴 Weak trust signals that scare buyers away  

✅ Once we fix these, **sales explode**.
